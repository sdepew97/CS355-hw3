Known Bugs:
1) Bug with SEGFAULT when you run exit sometimes (and not other times...haven't been able to catch it with gdb, yet!)
2) issue with strlen with parsing? got some funny errors with ls & ; cd? (wonder if there is an issue with null termination)
3) potential concurrency issues, since SIGCHLD is not yet implemented at all...
4) segfault in split whitespace
5) we know that jobs sometime

sometimes we go through and flag jobs...in long lists of jobs we end up loosing a sigchild and a job doesn't get marked as suspended (only appearance and not acutal functionality of shell)

To Be Done:
1) Concurrency
2) SIGCHLD handler
3) CTRL-Z functionality
