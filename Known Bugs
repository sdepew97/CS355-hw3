Known Bugs:
1) Bug with SEGFAULT when you run exit sometimes (and not other times...haven't been able to catch it with gdb, yet!)
2) issue with strlen with parsing? got some funny errors with ls & ; cd? (wonder if there is an issue with null termination)
3) potential concurrency issues, since SIGCHLD is not yet implemented at all...
4) segfault in split whitespace
5) issue with backgrounding jobs that causes core dump to occur
6) ==24663== Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
